This is a project with vs2010 to remesh surface triangular mesh. There are still a little bugs need to repair, but it does not affect your using. The program uses no third lib, so it is easy to be reappeared.  

I also have a more robust (almost without bugs) and fast (3 times) version, if you want, please email me.  

There are eight examples available in the repository you can use to check the performance of the program.   

Using same parameter as bellow, you will get the same results in our paper"123456".  
For joint mesh, mparam.maxh=0.035 and mparam.minh=0.03.   
For homer mesh, mparam.maxh=0.01 and mparam.minh=0.002.   
For torous mesh, mparam.maxh=1.0 and mparam.minh=0.7.   
For bone mesh, mparam.maxh=10.0 and mparam.minh=2.0.   
For Substrate mesh, mparam.maxh=100.0 and mparam.minh=5.0.   
For Spline mesh, mparam.maxh=10.0 and mparam.minh=5.0;   
For Valve mesh, mparam.maxh=10.0 and mparam.minh=0.5.  

Hope our program can help you and any problem, please contact me.
