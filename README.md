This is a project with vs2010 to remesh surface triangular mesh. There are still a little bugs need to repair, but it does not affect your using. The program uses no third lib, so it is easy to be reappeared.  
//
I also have a more robust (almost without no bugs) and fast (3 times) version, if you want, please email me.  
//
There are four examples available in the repository you can use to check the performance of the program.   
//
Using the same parameter in our paper ”123456”, you will get the same results.  
For joint.stl, mparam.maxh=0.035 and mparam.minh=0.03.   
For homer.stl, mparam.maxh=0.01 and mparam.minh=0.002.   
For torous.stl, mparam.maxh=1.0 and mparam.minh=0.7.   
For bone.stl, mparam.maxh=10.0 and mparam.minh=2.0.   
For Substrate.stl, mparam.maxh=100.0 and mparam.minh=5.0.   
For Spline.stl, mparam.maxh=10.0 and mparam.minh=5.0;   
For Valve.stl, mparam.maxh=10.0 and mparam.minh=0.5.

Hope our program can help you and any problem, please contact me.
